# NFL-Draft-Statistics
This is the repository used to host my code and research findings used for a summer research grant done through the National Science Foundation.
I worked by myself on this project from May 2020 to August 2020.
I was awarded $2,000 dollars for my work after submitting a final research report showcasing my findings.
