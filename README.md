# NFL-Draft-Statistics
- This is the repository used to host my code and research findings used for a summer research grant done through the National Science Foundation.
- I worked by myself on this project from May 2020 to August 2020.
- I was awarded $2,000 dollars for my work after submitting a final research report showcasing my findings.

- Within this repo, you can find my final submitted report, along with the code I made in order to interpret the data I collected.

# Goal of the Project
- The goal of this project was to learn more about what to look for at an NFL combine when trying to figure out if a player will end up being a good player in the NFL. Success is relative, so we had to set some sort of bar for players to be measured against, so I chose to count a player as succesful if they attended at least one pro-bowl in their career. The personal goal of this project was to learn more about data mining and statistical analysis. Through this project, I learned how to interpret data using Python and how to graphically display my findings.

There were more features I had intended to add to this project, but my supervising professor caught COVID at the time, so I was forced to learn everything on my own, which slowed down progress quite a lot. 
The features I intended included: 
- A GUI for selecting data from file folders instead of hard coding the path to the excel files
- A larger data pool
- A way to plug in a players measurements and immediately compare them to the existing data

# In order to run the code locally:
- download all files in Python Code folder
- Open each .Py file
- Change path for excel file to the path you saved the excel files at on your computer
- Run python code
